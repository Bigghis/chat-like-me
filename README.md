## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Exported Telegram chat data in JSON format

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-like-me.git
cd chat-like-me
```

No external dependencies needed! All scripts use Python standard library.

## Usage

### Step 1: Export Your Telegram Chats

1. Open **Telegram Desktop** (not mobile app)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Advanced** ‚Üí **Export Chat History**
3. Select the chats you want to export
4. Choose **JSON** as the export format
5. Disable media export (optional, to reduce file size)
6. Click **Export** and wait for completion
7. Locate the `result.json` file in your export folder

### Step 2: Discover Available Chats

```bash
python scripts/parse_chats.py --save-all --input result.json
```

This will show you all available chats with their IDs, types, and names:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name                                     Type                 ID             
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giuliana                                 personal_chat        164456975     
Marco                                    personal_chat        626965680       
Family Group                             private_group        1437880907   
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Extract Specific Conversations

If you want to work with individual conversations separately:

```bash
python scripts/extract_conversation.py result.json --id 460911860 --output chat_with_marco.json
```

### Step 4: Prepare Training Data

Transform your conversations into LLM training format:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py result.json \
  --output training_data.jsonl \
  --min-messages 20 \
  --your-name "YourName"
```

### Step 5: Fine-tune Your Model

Use the generated `training_data.jsonl` file with your preferred fine-tuning platform:
- OpenAI API
- Hugging Face
- Your custom training pipeline

## Scripts Documentation

### 1. `parse_chats.py` - Chat Discovery

Parse the Telegram export to identify all available chats.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/parse_chats.py --input result.json
```

**Filter by name:**
```bash
python scripts/parse_chats.py --name "Marco" --input result.json
```

**Filter by type:**
```bash
python scripts/parse_chats.py --type personal_chat --input result.json
```

### 2. `extract_conversation.py` - Conversation Extraction

Extract a specific conversation by ID into a separate file.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/extract_conversation.py result.json --id 168168628 --output my_chat.json
```

**List all conversations:**
```bash
python scripts/extract_conversation.py result.json --list
```

### 3. `prepare_training_data.py` - Training Data Preparation

Transform conversations into OpenAI-compatible training format.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--output` | training_data.jsonl | Output file path |
| `--min-messages` | 20 | Minimum messages required per contact |
| `--turn-window` | 5 | Time window (minutes) to group consecutive messages |
| `--conversation-gap` | 60 | Time gap (minutes) that separates conversations |
| `--your-name` | Pasquale | Your name in chats (identifies your messages) |
| `--include-groups` | False | Include group conversations |

**Advanced Examples:**

```bash
# Stricter filtering with custom time windows
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py result.json \
  --min-messages 50 \
  --turn-window 10 \
  --conversation-gap 120 \
  --your-name "YourName"

# Include group chats
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py result.json --include-groups

# Custom output location
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py result.json --output datasets/my_data.jsonl
```

**Output Format:**

The script generates a JSONL file where each line represents a complete conversation:

```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are YourName, chatting with Marco..."},
  {"role": "user", "name": "Marco", "content": "Hey, how are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "name": "YourName", "content": "I'm great! How about you?"}
]}
```

## How It Works

1. **Parsing**: The scripts parse your Telegram JSON export to identify all conversations
2. **Filtering**: Removes service messages, automated messages, and applies your filtering criteria
3. **Grouping**: Intelligently groups messages into conversation turns based on time windows
4. **Formatting**: Converts the data into the standard chat template format used by LLMs
5. **Output**: Generates a JSONL file ready for fine-tuning

## Data Privacy & Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Your chat data is personal and sensitive. These scripts:

- Run entirely **locally** on your machine
- Do **not** send data to any external service
- Do **not** require internet connection
- Give you full control over what data to export and process

**Recommendations:**
- Keep your exported JSON files secure
- Don't share your training data publicly unless you're comfortable with it
- Review the generated training data before using it
- Consider anonymizing sensitive information if needed

## Use Cases

### Personal Chatbot
Train a model that can respond to messages in your style when you're busy.

### Writing Assistant
Create a tool that helps you draft messages in your unique voice.

### Communication Analysis
Understand your conversation patterns and communication style.

### Creative Projects
Build interactive experiences based on your conversational personality.

## Troubleshooting

### "No chats meet the criteria"
Try lowering the `--min-messages` threshold or check if your export contains valid conversations.

### "Unexpected JSON structure"
Ensure you exported in JSON format from Telegram Desktop, not mobile.

### Unicode/Encoding Issues
The scripts handle UTF-8 encoding automatically, but ensure your terminal supports Unicode.
