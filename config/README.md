# Fine-tuning Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for fine-tuning your personalized language model using Axolotl.

## Coming Soon

- `axolotl_config.yml` - Pre-configured Axolotl training setup
- Model-specific configurations (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- Optimization settings for different GPU sizes
- Training instructions and best practices

## What is Axolotl?

[Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) is a tool for fine-tuning large language models with an easy-to-use YAML configuration system. It supports:

- LoRA and QLoRA for efficient training
- Multiple model architectures
- Advanced training techniques
- Easy deployment and inference

## Stay Tuned

Configuration files will be added soon. In the meantime, you can use the generated `training_data.jsonl` from the scripts directory with any LLM fine-tuning platform.
